## About

wolup is a tool for waking up computers through Wake on LAN (WOL). It is
written in Python and has been tested with Python 3.5.2 and 3.5.3. It should
work just fine with more recent versions of Python 3.

The tool is based on `wake-on-lan.py` by Georg Kainzbauer. It was originally
published at <http://www.gtkdb.de/index_31_2254.html>.
